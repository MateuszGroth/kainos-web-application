CoinTrends Challenge 2018

This app uses Canvasjs library to display a chart of BTC, ETH, LTC values. All of them are shown on the same chart but with three different value scales (which are all logarithmic). Thanks to that solution, oscillations of their values are easier to notice. User is able to zoom in change the time range on the chart and turn on and off any of the presented series. It is also possible to switch between three types of data with different time ranges, specified by data provider - API bitcoinaverage. Monthly Data - values of BTC, ETH, LTC from every full hour during last ~35 days. After selecting this option, weekly BTC value growth / drop trends as well as two buttons that allow checking differences between current BTC value and BTC value from  one hour ago/ one day ago/ one week ago can will be displayed (based on that information, green arrow or red arrow will appear). Daily Data - values of BTC, ETH, LTC from every 'full minute' during last ~30 hours and last but not least, Alltime Data - values of BTC, ETH, LTC from every day eversince they have been created.
